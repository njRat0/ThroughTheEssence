# ThroughTheEssence

It`s my first test project on java

In this game you will have to survive waves of enemies and gradually upgrade your character and your abilities. With each new wave, monsters become stronger and new mechanics appear. At the beginning, you must choose the class of your hero. Each of the classes has different parameters (Descriptions of the characteristics of the classes are in a separate text file of the game). To win, you must hold out for 600 seconds.

For the current test version of the game, there are: 3 character classes; 5 types of weapons; 6 types of skills; 16 different monsters; 1 boss
